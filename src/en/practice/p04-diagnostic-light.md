# Practice 4. Simplified Diagnostic

This page is for when you want a quick snapshot of your relationship.  
Instead of going in circles, it helps each of you name the conditions, needs, and functions that matter most right now.

**You’ll need:** pen, paper (or this page)  
**Time:** 15–20 minutes  
**Use when:**  
- You want to quickly see what’s going on right now  
- You feel stuck in the same arguments  
- You want to move from “talking” to “understanding”

## Step 1. Individual selection

### 1. Choose up to 5 key conditions that influence your life right now:

<br/>
____________________________________________________________
<br/><br/>
____________________________________________________________
<br/><br/>
____________________________________________________________

### 2. Choose up to 5 needs that are most important to you right now:

<br/>
____________________________________________________________
<br/><br/>
____________________________________________________________
<br/><br/>
____________________________________________________________

### 3. Assess the functions:

* What I do well:

<br/>
____________________________________________________________

* What I lack:

<br/>
____________________________________________________________

## Step 2. Short answers

Answer freely (in 2–3 sentences):

* What do I like about how we live now?

<br/>
____________________________________________________________

* What is the hardest for me right now in our relationship?

<br/>
____________________________________________________________

* Which of my personal strengths supports our relationship?

<br/>
____________________________________________________________

* What do I need most from you right now?

<br/>
____________________________________________________________

## Step 3. Joint discussion

After filling it out individually, discuss together:

* Where the selected conditions and needs overlap, where they differ.
* What each person does well and where support is needed.
* Read your short answers to each other.

**Outcome:** A shared snapshot of your current conditions, needs, and functions, turning vague frustration into clear talking points.
