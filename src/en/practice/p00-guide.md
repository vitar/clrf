# Practices Guide

The next twelve practices are the practical part of this book — a toolbox you can use to turn reflection into action.<br/>
They are not “tasks” to complete in order, but simple tools to choose from depending on what you need most.

## How to use this section

- **Pick one practice at a time**<br/>
You don’t need to do all twelve in a row. Start with the one that feels most relevant today. If you’re unsure, begin with **[Practice 1](../practice/p01-conditions-checklist.md), [2](../practice/p02-needs-checklist.md), [3](../practice/p03-functions-checklist.md)** (Conditions, Needs, Functions) to get a clear snapshot of where you are.

- **Use them in different ways**<br/>
Some practices are quick checklists (15 minutes), others are deeper conversations (30–40 minutes). Choose what fits your time and energy.

- **Repeat and return**<br/>
These tools are reusable. A practice that felt “done” last month might reveal something new if you try it again later.

- **Combine when useful**<br/>
Practices connect naturally. For example:
    - Use **[Practice 5 (Individual Vision)](../practice/p05-individual-vision.md)** before **[Practice 12 (Shared Vision)](../practice/p12-shared-vision.md)**.
    - Use **[Practice 6 (Change Table)](../practice/p06-change-table.md)** together with **[Practice 7 (Priority Matrix)](../practice/p07-priority-matrix.md)** to turn vision into steps and priorities.
    - Use **[Practice 8 (Retrospective)](../practice/p08-retrospective.md)** to check in regularly and decide which practice to try next.

- **Make it yours**<br/>
Adapt the wording, change the order, or shorten the steps. The framework is here to support you, not to limit you.

## Outcome

A practical, flexible way to keep your relationship healthy and intentional.<br/>
Think of these practices as conversation starters and structure builders — small, repeatable tools that help you act on what matters most.
