# Practice 1. Conditions Checklist

Use this page when life feels messy or when arguments circle around “stuff.”<br/>
Checking conditions together shows what’s shaping your daily rhythm before you jump into needs or fixes.

**You’ll need:** pen, paper (or this page)<br/>
**Time:** 10–15 minutes<br/>
**Use when:**

- You feel stuck in repeating arguments
- You want to see what’s shaping your week
- You’re about to talk about needs or functions

## 1. Material conditions
