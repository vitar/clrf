# Practice 2. Needs Checklist

This checklist will help you identify personal and shared needs.
Choose the most significant ones for you and add your own if needed.
You can also set priorities (for example, from 1 to 5).

## 1. Physiological / basic

☐ Health (sleep, nutrition, physical activity)

☐ Sexual intimacy

☐ Safety (housing, financial stability)

## 2. Emotional / psychological

☐ Love and attachment (feeling loved and needed)

☐ Recognition and respect (feeling valued in your partner’s eyes)

☐ Support and attention (empathy, care)

☐ Emotional safety (ability to be yourself without fear)

## 3. Development / growth

☐ Personal development (learning, skills, creativity)

☐ Self-realization (sense of meaning and achievement)

☐ Novelty and experiences (travel, hobbies, new practices)

## 4. Shared / couple

☐ Common goals (the family's future, projects, plans)

☐ Traditions and rituals (shared holidays, routines)

☐ Shared time (quality, not just quantity)

☐ Sense of “we” (identity of the couple, not just two individuals)

## 5. Social / external

☐ Recognition as a couple (from family, friends, and the community)

☐ Social support (to avoid isolation)

☐ Harmony with the surrounding environment (minimal external pressure)
