# Practice 2. Needs Checklist

Use this page to uncover what you really need right now—both as an individual and as a couple.<br/>
Needs often hide behind arguments about chores, money, or time. Naming them directly turns tension into understanding.

**You’ll need:** pen, paper (or this page)<br/>
**Time:** 10–15 minutes<br/>
**Use when:**

- Arguments repeat without resolution
- You feel unseen or misunderstood
- You want to connect what matters to “I” and to “We”

## 1. Physiological / basic

- ☐ Health (sleep, nutrition, physical activity)
- ☐ Sexual intimacy
- ☐ Safety (housing, financial stability)

## 2. Emotional / psychological

- ☐ Love and attachment (feeling loved and needed)
- ☐ Recognition and respect (feeling valued in your partner’s eyes)
- ☐ Support and attention (empathy, care)
- ☐ Emotional safety (ability to be yourself without fear)

## 3. Development / growth

- ☐ Personal development (learning, skills, creativity)
- ☐ Self-realization (sense of meaning and achievement)
- ☐ Novelty and experiences (travel, hobbies, new practices)

## 4. Shared / couple

- ☐ Common goals (the family’s future, projects, plans)
- ☐ Traditions and rituals (shared holidays, routines)
- ☐ Shared time (quality, not just quantity)
- ☐ Sense of “we” (identity of the couple, not just two individuals)

## 5. Social / external

- ☐ Recognition as a couple (from family, friends, and the community)
- ☐ Social support (to avoid isolation)
- ☐ Harmony with the surrounding environment (minimal external pressure)
