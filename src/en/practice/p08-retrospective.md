# Practice 8. Retrospective Template

A retrospective is a gentle joint discussion to reflect on your relationship.<br/>
It helps you notice what’s working, what’s hard, and where small improvements can make life together better.<br/>
Holding it once a month or once a quarter keeps your connection fresh and intentional.

**You’ll need:** pen, paper (or this page)<br/>
**Time:** 30–40 minutes<br/>
**Use when:**

- You want to check in regularly, not just when problems appear
- You feel stuck in routines and want to reflect together
- You want a safe space to share gratitude and requests
