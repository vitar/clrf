# Practice 7. Priority Matrix

This matrix helps prioritize selected changes. Distribute them across four quadrants depending on importance and urgency. Use it as a tool for joint discussion.

| Important and urgent (do immediately)             | Important but not urgent (plan)      |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Not important but urgent (delegate/minimize)      | Not important and not urgent (discard) |

Note: start by distributing 3â€“5 key changes. This helps focus on what truly matters and reduces overload.
