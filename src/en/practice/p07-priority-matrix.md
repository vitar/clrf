# Practice 7. Priority Matrix

This matrix helps you prioritize selected changes. Distribute them into four quadrants based on importance and urgency. Use it as a tool for a joint discussion.

<style>
    table {
        width: 100%;
    }
</style>
|||
|:--:|:--:|
| Important and urgent (do immediately)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> | Important but not urgent (plan) |
| Not important but urgent (delegate or minimize)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> | Not important and not urgent (discard) |

Note: Start by distributing 3â€“5 key changes. This helps you focus on what truly matters and reduces overload.
