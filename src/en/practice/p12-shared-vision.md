# Practice 12. Shared Vision
# Practice 12. Shared Vision

This practice helps form a common picture of the future. First each shares their individual vision, then together you create a shared one. It should include a common core (what matches) and respectful acknowledgment of differences (what remains personal).

### 1. Our common core (overlaps)

What is important for both of us in the future:

____________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________

### 2. Our differences (space for the personal)

What remains personal for each:

____________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________

### 3. Joint formulation of the vision

Try to jointly formulate 2–3 paragraphs describing your shared vision:

____________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________

## Conclusion

A shared vision is a guideline, not a rigid plan. It helps move in the same direction while preserving each partner’s individuality.
