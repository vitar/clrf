# Practice 12. Shared Vision

This page helps you create a shared picture of the future.<br/>
First, each partner shares their individual vision; then you bring them together.<br/>
The shared vision should highlight the common core (what matches) and also respect differences (what remains personal).

**You’ll need:** pen, paper (or this page)<br/>
**Time:** 30–40 minutes<br/>
**Use when:**

- You’ve already written individual visions
- You want to align your direction as a couple
- You want to see how similarities and differences can both enrich your future

### 1. Our common core (overlaps)

What is important for both of us in the future:

<br/>
____________________________________________________________
<br/><br/>
____________________________________________________________
<br/><br/>
____________________________________________________________

### 2. Our differences (space for the personal)

What remains personal for each:

<br/>
____________________________________________________________
<br/><br/>
____________________________________________________________
<br/><br/>
____________________________________________________________

### 3. Joint formulation of the vision

Together, write 2–3 paragraphs that describe your shared vision:

<br/>
____________________________________________________________
<br/><br/>
____________________________________________________________
<br/><br/>
____________________________________________________________

## Conclusion

A shared vision is a compass, not a rigid plan.
It helps you move in the same direction while honoring each partner’s individuality.

**Outcome:** A clear and motivating vision that combines “I” and “We” into a shared path forward.
