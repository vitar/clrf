# Practice 9. RACI

This page helps distribute roles and responsibilities fairly in your relationship.<br/>
The method is adapted from project management but works just as well at home. It reduces hidden assumptions and makes agreements visible.

**You’ll need:** pen, paper (or this page)<br/>
**Time:** 20–30 minutes<br/>
**Use when:**

- You keep bumping into the same chores or tasks
- You feel responsibilities are uneven or unclear
- You want more transparency in daily life

The principle is simple:

- **Responsible** — who does the work
- **Accountable** — who carries final responsibility and approves the result
- **Consulted** — whose input is needed before acting
- **Informed** — who should know once it’s done

| Area / task | Responsible<br/>(who does the work) | Accountable<br/>(final responsibility) | Consulted<br/>(whose input is needed) | Informed<br/>(who is kept updated) |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Finances<br/>(budget, payments)<br/><br/><br/><br/> |||||
| Household chores<br/>(cleaning, cooking)<br/><br/><br/><br/> |||||
| Children<br/>(school, activities)<br/><br/><br/><br/> |||||
| Relatives<br/>(communication, holidays)<br/><br/><br/><br/> |||||
| Leisure and vacation<br/>(planning)<br/><br/><br/><br/> |||||

**Outcome:** Clear agreements on “who does what” — lowering conflict and giving both partners confidence that responsibilities are shared fairly.
