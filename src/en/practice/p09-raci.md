# Practice 9. RACI

This practice helps distribute roles and responsibilities in your relationship. The method is based on the RACI principle: Responsible (who does the work), Accountable (who is ultimately answerable and approves the result), Consulted (whose opinions are sought before a decision), Informed (who is kept updated after decisions and actions). Fill the table together to reduce misunderstandings and conflicts.
