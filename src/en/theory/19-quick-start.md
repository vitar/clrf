# Quick Start Guide: Your First Conversation

This book is designed to be read in order, but life doesn’t always wait.

If you are feeling stuck, disconnected, or overwhelmed right now, this page is for you.

Here is a simple 15-minute exercise to have one productive conversation today. Use it as your first step.

## Step 1: Choose the scenario that fits you most today

**If you feel disconnected or like you’re living parallel lives…**

- Turn to **[Practice 4: Simplified Diagnostic](../practice/p04-diagnostic-light.md)**.
- Individually, answer just these two questions:
    1. *What do I like about how we live now?*
    2. *What do I need most from you right now?*
- Share only your answers with each other. Don’t try to solve anything yet — just listen.

**If you feel overwhelmed by chores and responsibilities…**

- Turn to **[Practice 4: Simplified Diagnostic](../practice/p04-diagnostic-light.md)**.
- Individually, pick one or two *key conditions* related to household or work schedules.
- Then, name one *personal strength* that supports your relationship.
- Share these with each other. The goal today is not to fix everything, but to acknowledge the pressure and appreciate each other’s strengths.
    - *(For a deeper tool on this, see **[Practice 9: RACI](../practice/p09-raci.md)** later in the book.)*

**If you feel anxious about the future…**

- Turn to **[Practice 5: Individual Vision](../practice/p05-individual-vision.md)**.
- Don’t complete the whole page. Just answer this one question:
    - *What is most important to me in a relationship?*
- Share your answers. The goal isn’t to create a five-year plan, but to connect on your core values.

## Step 2: Take a breath and talk

Choose one of these paths and give it about 15 minutes.

Keep it light: short answers, gentle listening, no pressure to solve.

## Step 3: Bridge back to the book

This single conversation is just a starting point.

To understand the deeper patterns behind these feelings and to build lasting change, continue with **Chapter 2**, where we explore the *Conditions* that shape your life together.
