# Chapter 6. Vision

A vision is a picture of the future that a person or couple wants to move toward. It sets direction and gives shape to change. Unlike fantasies, a real vision is built on actual conditions and needs, so it has weight and can guide action. A clear vision does more than set a direction; it creates a shared sense of belonging and lends the courage to act—turning hope into something you can move with.

## 1. Individual visions

Each partner begins with their own picture of the future. Write it in the first person: *“I want…”*, *“I see myself…”*. These visions reflect personal needs, dreams, and goals. They won’t match completely—and that’s fine. Naming them makes the inner world visible and easier to respect, even when it differs.

## 2. Seeing your partner’s vision

One useful step is to write how you imagine your partner’s vision: *“I think it’s important for you…”*. This simple reflection often reveals gaps in understanding and shows how closely you know each other. Shared back with openness, it builds trust and creates gratitude for being noticed.

## 3. Joint vision

Once both personal visions are shared, you can sketch a joint picture. It includes what overlaps (the common core) and what stays personal. A good joint vision is realistic enough to be reachable and inspiring enough to energize. Belonging grows when you can point to a shared purpose, and respect deepens when differences are left in view rather than hidden.

## 4. Personal goals and fantasies

Not every dream can be realized. Still, naming fantasies matters because they reveal values. The wish for *“a house by the sea”* might point to the value of calm and open space. That value can be honored in other forms—quiet weekends, time in nature—even if the house never comes. Curiosity here turns frustration into clearer understanding.

## 5. Comparing and combining visions

Laying visions side by side helps you see:

- **Overlaps** — the common core that anchors the shared path.
- **Differences** — areas where you compromise or simply protect what’s personal.

A combined vision holds both: the shared core and the respected differences. This balance builds a sense of unity without erasing individuality. The ability to carry both strengthens resilience and makes trust in the shared path more real.

## Conclusion

A vision is a guide, not a blueprint. It gives direction and inspiration but stays flexible as conditions and needs shift. When practiced with honesty and a light touch, visioning is not only strategic but also connecting — it turns dreams into a map of shared hope.
