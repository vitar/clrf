# Chapter 7. Changes

Changes are the bridge between the current situation and the vision of the future. They allow abstract wishes to be turned into concrete steps. Changes vary in scale – from daily habits to major decisions. Approached with patience and respect, changes reduce fear and create hope.

## 1. Categories of change

- Radical – large, long-term steps (moving, changing jobs, decisions about having children).  
  These require courage, trust, and mutual encouragement.  
- Compromise – agreements (division of duties, schedules, boundaries with relatives).  
  Compromise works best when guided by fairness and respect.  
- Micro-changes – small habits and rituals (gadget-free dinner, daily compliments, morning coffee together).  
  Micro-changes create belonging and gratitude in daily rhythm.  

## 2. Gap analysis

Gap analysis helps compare the current state with the desired future:

- Where we are now.
- Where we want to be.
- What changes are needed to bridge the gap.

This method helps define steps systematically. It also lowers frustration, turning doubt into clarity.

## 3. Examples of changes

### Example 1

- Current state: little time together.
- Desired future: more emotional closeness.
- Change: introduce a weekly gadget-free evening (micro-change).

This builds belonging and calm.

### Example 2

- Current state: financial instability.
- Desired future: confidence and stability.
- Change: create a joint budget and savings strategy (radical).

This nurtures trust and patience.

### Example 3

- Current state: conflicts about household chores.
- Desired future: fair division of household duties.
- Change: make a list of duties and redistribute them (compromise).

This restores respect and reduces resentment.  

## 4. Shared and personal changes

It is important to distinguish:

- Shared changes (what concern the couple).
- Personal changes (what each does for themselves).

Balance means moving in both directions: developing both the “we” and the “I”. Encouraging each other in personal changes creates recognition and shared pride, while shared changes strengthen unity.

## Conclusion

Change is a process, not a one-time decision. It requires time, agreement, and readiness to adjust. Even small steps can lead to big results over time. When changes are guided by clarity, curiosity, and mutual support, they transform pressure into progress and open space for growth together.
