# Chapter 5. Links

Conditions, needs, and functions do not exist separately. They are connected in the sequence: Condition → Need → Function. This logic helps us understand how reality shapes requests and how requests determine actions. When links are named clearly, they reduce frustration, build curiosity, and turn tension into practical steps.

## 1. Condition → Need

Examples:

- Condition: little time together → Need: closeness, togetherness.  
  Awareness shifts focus from blame (“we never meet”) to belonging (“I need to feel close to you”).  
- Condition: financial instability → Need: safety, confidence.  
  Naming the need reduces anxiety and creates patience for shared solutions.  
- Condition: pressure from relatives → Need: autonomy, boundaries.  
  Respectful recognition of this need avoids resentment and restores balance.  
- Condition: chronic stress → Need: emotional safety.  
  Honest acknowledgment invites empathy instead of defensiveness.  

## 2. Need → Function

Examples:

- Need: recognition → Function: communication (gratitude, compliments).  
  Gratitude and validation nurture trust and closeness.  
- Need: shared time → Function: cooperation (planning leisure time).  
  Respectful planning creates belonging and fairness.  
- Need: emotional safety → Function: support (empathy, attention).  
  Support offered with patience and care reduces fear.  
- Need: development → Function: joint development (new projects, learning).  
  Shared growth inspires hope and keeps the relationship alive.  

## 3. Personal functions and their impact on shared ones

Strong personal functions reduce the load on shared functions. For example, if a person can manage stress, there are fewer conflicts. If they have hobbies and social connections, their partner does not become the sole source of joy and recognition. This creates space for curiosity and playfulness in the shared “we”.

Weak personal functions increase the load on shared functions: a lack of autonomy, social connections, or self-regulation can create excessive expectations and tension. Resentment often arises here, but awareness and encouragement can restore balance.

## 4. Universal formula

Condition (background) → Need (request) → Function (mode of action)

Example:

- Condition: lots of work, little time.
- Need: to be closer and communicate.
- Shared function: a weekly gadget-free evening.
- Personal function: managing fatigue to stay engaged.

This sequence turns stress into clarity, and helps couples move from “we can’t” to “let’s try”.

## Conclusion

Links turn abstract conversations (“we need more closeness”) into concrete steps (“we set aside an evening, we create a ritual”). This is the key to practical use of the framework. When couples practice linking with honesty, patience, and respect, they move from confusion to clarity and from distance to belonging.
