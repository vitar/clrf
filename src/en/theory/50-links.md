# Chapter 5. Links

Conditions, needs and functions do not exist separately. They are connected in the sequence: Condition → Need → Function. This logic helps understand how reality shapes requests and how requests determine actions.

## 1. Condition → Need

Examples:

- Condition: little shared time → Need: closeness, togetherness.
- Condition: unstable finances → Need: safety, confidence.
- Condition: pressure from relatives → Need: autonomy, boundaries.
- Condition: chronic stress → Need: emotional safety.

## 2. Need → Function

Examples:

- Need: recognition → Function: communication (gratitude, compliments).
- Need: shared time → Function: cooperation (planning leisure).
- Need: emotional safety → Function: support (empathy, attention).
- Need: development → Function: joint development (new projects, learning).

## 3. Personal functions and their impact on shared ones

Strong personal functions reduce the load on shared ones. For example, if a person can manage stress, there are fewer conflicts. If they have hobbies and social connections, the partner does not become the sole source of joy and recognition.

Weak personal functions increase the load on shared ones: lack of autonomy, friends or self-regulation can create excessive expectations and tension.

## 4. Universal formula

Condition (background) → Need (request) → Function (mode of action)

Example:

- Condition: lots of work, little time.
- Need: to be closer and communicate.
- Shared function: a weekly evening without gadgets.
- Personal function: managing fatigue to stay engaged.

## Conclusion

Links turn abstract conversations (“we need more closeness”) into concrete steps (“we set aside an evening, we create a ritual”). This is the key to practical use of the framework.
