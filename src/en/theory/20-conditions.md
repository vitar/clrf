# Chapter 2. Conditions

Conditions are the backdrop of your life together. They don’t ask for permission; they set the stage. Seeing them clearly helps you decide which needs are being pulled forward and which actions are worth trying next.

## Categories of conditions

1. Material – housing, finances, household.
2. Time – work schedules, free time, rhythm of life.
3. Social – family, friends, community, social roles.
4. Cultural and value conditions – faith, worldview, values, cultural environment.
5. Non-material personal – health, emotional background, personal space.

## 1. Material conditions

These include housing, income, financial stability, the split of household duties, and the shape of daily routines. It’s no surprise that limited space can create tension or that unstable finances can keep both partners on edge. Yet these are also chances to act together. A simple shared plan — who does what by when, what we postpone, what we protect — turns a stressful topic into a steadying one and slowly builds trust that outlasts money or square meters.

## 2. Time conditions

When you map your time openly — where it overlaps, where it doesn’t — you can trade small adjustments (bedtimes, errands, quiet hours) that make the week feel shared instead of mismatched.

## 3. Social conditions

Just as schedules shape our days, our social circles shape our energy. 

Naming these dynamics out loud reduces the “invisible pressure” that breeds resentment. It also gives you a moment to thank the people who actually help, which makes boundaries easier to hold.

## 4. Cultural and value conditions

As relationships live inside families and communities, they also live inside cultures and values. 

Different values will surface sooner or later; treating them as data points rather than verdicts keeps the conversation moving. Looking for one value you both care about — fairness, freedom, honesty — creates a place to stand while you sort out the rest.

## 5. Non-material personal conditions

Underneath social and cultural currents lies the personal baseline we stand on. 

Protecting your own footing matters. Small care routines — like sleep windows, a screen-free break, or a short walk — lower the general noise level, while clear signals (“I need 30 minutes alone,” “I’m available after eight”) help both of you navigate needs without guesswork.

## Conclusion

Conditions aren’t right or wrong — they’re the weather. Naming the weather lets you pack the right gear: which needs are active, which functions you’ll lean on this week, and which experiments are worth a try.
