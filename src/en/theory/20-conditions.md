# Chapter 2. Conditions

Conditions are the background and environment in which the couple lives. They create the frame that can support the relationship or, on the contrary, complicate it. Conditions cannot always be changed immediately, but they must be acknowledged to understand what needs arise and which functions should be activated.

## Categories of conditions

1. Material – housing, finances, household.
2. Time – work schedules, free time, rhythm of life.
3. Social – family, friends, community, social roles.
4. Cultural and value conditions – faith, worldview, values, cultural environment.
5. Non-material personal – health, emotional background, personal space.

## 1. Material conditions

These include housing, income level, financial stability, distribution of household duties, and the presence of a comfortable daily routine. Material conditions create basic stability. For example, limited living space can generate tension, and financial instability can increase anxiety.

## 2. Time conditions

Time is a key resource in relationships. Work schedules, the overlap or mismatch of free time, and the overall rhythm of life (for example, "lark" and "owl") directly influence the quality of shared leisure and the possibility of emotional closeness.

## 3. Social conditions

Family, children, relatives, and their involvement in the couple's life can be both a source of support and a factor of pressure. Friends and community give a sense of belonging but sometimes create expectations. Social roles (for example, professional status) also impose obligations.

## 4. Cultural and value conditions

This includes faith, philosophical or spiritual beliefs, and a value system — honesty, respect, freedom. Cultural environment, traditions, and language form the context in which the couple lives. Different values can be a source of conflicts, while shared values are a strong unifying factor.

## 5. Non-material personal conditions

This includes health (physical and mental), emotional state, and personal space. If one partner has chronic stress or no time for themselves, it directly affects the couple. Caring for such conditions helps to reduce tension and maintain balance.

## Conclusion

Conditions are not "right" or "wrong." They are the reality that is important to acknowledge. Awareness of conditions determines which needs will be relevant and which functions will have to be activated.
