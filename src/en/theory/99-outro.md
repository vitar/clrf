# Chapter 10. Conclusion

The “Couple Life System Framework” offers a structure that helps couples approach their relationships consciously. It is built on three levels: conditions, needs and functions. These levels form the foundation for evaluation, vision and change.

## 1. Framework summary

- Conditions – the background and environment that affect the relationship.
- Needs – internal requests forming motivation.
- Functions – actions and mechanisms that satisfy needs.

Together they create a map that helps understand where we are and where we want to move.

## 2. Practical value

The framework allows you to:

- Avoid confusion between facts and desires.
- Separate personal and shared while maintaining balance.
- Turn abstract conversations into concrete steps.
- Build visions grounded in reality.
- Plan changes without overload.

## 3. Use in life

This tool is not a substitute for emotions or intuition. It helps them take shape. You can use it regularly or return to it when you feel the relationship needs renewal and review.

## 4. Final word

Relationships are a living process. The framework helps make it more conscious and flexible. It does not give ready-made recipes but offers a map on which each couple can find their own path.
