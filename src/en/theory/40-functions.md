# Chapter 4. Functions

Functions are the ways you act — together and individually — to meet current needs under real conditions. When you treat them as living behaviors rather than chores, they give energy back instead of draining it.

## Categories of functions

1. Shared functions – ensure interaction and shared life.
2. Personal functions – help each person remain whole and develop.

## 1. Shared functions

They include:

- **Communication**<br/>
  Think of it as the engine of the relationship — the way you share feelings, make decisions, and find your way back to each other after conflict. A simple habit like “pause → name what I feel → ask one question” keeps old arguments from looping and turns friction into movement.
- **Support**<br/>
  Emotional, practical, financial. Agree on the shape of help before the moment is hot — “When I say ‘swamped’, please sit with me for five minutes / take the dishes tonight / check the budget with me Thursday.” Specific help offered at the right time builds trust much faster than generic promises.
- **Cooperation**<br/>
  Who does what, and how you switch when life changes. A visible list of shared tasks with “owner”, “backup”, and “trade rules” cuts down on score - keeping and keeps fairness from being a feeling to being a system.
- **Intimacy**<br/>
  Physical, emotional, intellectual. Protect one small window that doesn’t get negotiated away (a device-free half hour, a weekly walk, a slow coffee). Consistency does more for closeness than intensity.
- **Joint development**<br/>
  Projects, learning, rituals, new experiences. Pick one tiny thing to build this month—a photo album, two - song dance break, trying a class — and schedule it like anything else you care about. Shared novelty keeps the “we” feeling elastic.

These functions form the foundation of the “we,” nurturing connection and resilience over time.

## 2. Personal functions

While shared functions build your life together, personal functions are the roots that keep the “we” healthy — they give each of you a solid place to stand.

They include:

- **Self-care**<br/>
  Health, rest, stress habits. Decide one recovery move you’ll actually use this week; tell your partner when it happens so they can protect it — your rest is a resource for both of you.
- **Emotional work**<br/>
  Self-reflection, regulation, self-worth. A short check-in like “name the feeling → name the need → choose one request” reduces what the relationship has to carry — lighter “I” makes a steadier “we.”
- **Hobbies and interests**<br/>
  Joy in personal pursuits adds fresh air to the couple’s rhythm. Share results, not schedules—“show and tell” brings your partner in without turning hobbies into chores.
- **Social self-realization**<br/>
  Work, friends, contribution. Keeping two or three outside connections alive prevents the relationship from carrying the entire weight of recognition.
- **Personal development**<br/>
  Learning, practices, new experiences. One micro-experiment per month is enough; confidence grows from reps, not leaps.

These functions help a person stay fulfilled and avoid overloading the relationship. Encouragement from a partner turns individual pursuits into shared pride.

## Balance of personal and shared functions

Strong personal functions ease the shared ones: for example, if a person can cope with stress, the partner does not become the sole source of support. Weak personal functions, on the contrary, overload the relationship: when there are no hobbies or friends, the partner has to compensate for everything.

Balance isn’t a 50/50 split; it’s a feedback loop. When “I” is resourced, “we” needs less firefighting. When “we” is steady, “I” has room to grow. Use small signals — “I’m good / I’m low” — to adjust before strain becomes a story.

## Conclusion

Functions are switches you can flip on purpose. Pick a few, make them visible, and let them do the quiet work of keeping the relationship moving.
