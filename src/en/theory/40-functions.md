# Chapter 4. Functions

Functions are ways of acting through which the couple and each partner satisfy their needs under given conditions. Functions are divided into shared (that serve the couple) and personal (that serve each individual). Their balance determines the stability of the relationship. When functions are seen not just as tasks but as living expressions of care, respect, and curiosity, they bring energy rather than burden.

## Categories of functions

1. Shared functions – ensure interaction and shared life.
2. Personal functions – help each person remain whole and develop.

## 1. Shared functions

They include:

- Communication (discussing emotions, decision-making, conflict resolution).  
  Done with clarity and patience, communication transforms tension into understanding.  
- Support (emotional, practical, financial).  
  Offering support with empathy and gratitude strengthens trust and belonging.  
- Cooperation (division of duties, agreements, and flexibility).  
  Cooperation based on respect reduces resentment and creates fairness.  
- Intimacy (physical, emotional, intellectual).  
  Intimacy thrives where curiosity, safety, and playfulness are present.  
- Joint development (projects, learning, rituals, new experiences).  
  Shared growth invites inspiration and keeps the relationship resilient.  

These functions form the foundation of the “we,” nurturing connection and resilience over time.

## 2. Personal functions

They include:

- Self-care (health, stress management, rest).  
  Practicing self-care creates calm and prevents overload.  
- Emotional work (self-reflection, self-regulation, self-worth).  
  This builds clarity and courage, reducing defensiveness.  
- Hobbies and interests (creativity, sports, pursuits).  
  Joy in personal interests adds playfulness and energy to the couple’s rhythm.  
- Social self-realization (work, friends, contribution to society).  
  Social expression reinforces identity and belonging beyond the couple.  
- Personal development (learning, spiritual practices, new experiences).  
  Personal growth sparks curiosity and hope for the future.  

These functions help a person stay fulfilled and avoid overloading the relationship. Encouragement from a partner turns individual pursuits into shared pride.

## Balance of personal and shared functions

Strong personal functions ease the shared ones: for example, if a person can cope with stress, the partner does not become the sole source of support. Weak personal functions, on the contrary, overload the relationship: when there are no hobbies or friends, the partner has to compensate for everything.

Balance is achieved when personal and shared do not contradict each other but reinforce one another. Balance is also emotional: trust and patience in “we” grow when “I” is supported with respect and recognition.

## Conclusion

Functions are not obligations or rules. They are mechanisms activated to satisfy needs. They can be implemented through different practices, and this is where the framework’s flexibility comes from. Approached with calm, curiosity, and playfulness, functions become a source of strength rather than a source of pressure.
