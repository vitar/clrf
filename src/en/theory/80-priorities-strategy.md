# Chapter 8. Prioritization and Strategy

After naming changes, the next step is to decide which matter most and how to carry them out. Without priorities, couples risk overload: too many goals at once lead to burnout or giving up. Clear priorities bring calm and focus, and a shared strategy turns plans into trust and steady progress.

## 1. Prioritization

Ways to set priorities:

- **Eisenhower Matrix** — sort by importance and urgency, that makes the load visible and easier to manage:
    - Important + urgent → do now.
    - Important + not urgent → plan.
    - Not important + urgent → delegate or shrink.
    - Not important + not urgent → drop.
    
    This simple grid replaces the anxiety of a long to-do list with the calm of a shared, manageable plan.
- **The “Top 3” rule** — pick no more than three key changes for the next 3–6 months.<br/>
  Fewer priorities protect energy and make success feel reachable.
- **Balance** — include both shared and personal changes.<br/>
  Balance honors individuality and togetherness at the same time.

## 2. Strategy

A strategy is the set of principles and routines that keep you on course:

- **Principles** — e.g., *“we raise big issues once a week”* or *“we avoid decisions during conflict.”*<br/>
  Principles create predictability and reduce defensiveness.

- **Rituals** — e.g., weekly planning, monthly retrospective.<br/>
  Rituals remind you that you are a team and keep the rhythm steady.

- **Progress checks** — e.g., once a month review the table of changes.<br/>
  Reviews make progress visible, which builds recognition and hope.

## 3. Mini-rituals

Small practices sustain the bigger plan:

- **Daily check-in** — a quick *“How are you today?”* keeps the channel open.
- **Weekly sync** — share plans and moods before the week begins.
- **Monthly retrospective** — ask what worked, what to improve.

These short rituals reduce hidden resentment and keep honesty safe. Done with lightness, they feel less like chores and more like connection.

## Conclusion

Prioritization and strategy turn intentions into action. They show what matters now, what can wait, and how to keep moving toward the vision together. Practiced with clarity and encouragement, they make planning not a burden but a source of confidence and belonging.
