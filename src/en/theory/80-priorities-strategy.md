# Chapter 8. Prioritization and Strategy

After defining changes, it is important to set priorities and work out a strategy for implementing them. Without this, there is a risk of overload: too many goals at once lead to burnout or giving up on change. Clear priorities create calm and focus, while a shared strategy nurtures trust and belonging.

## 1. Prioritization

Methods of prioritization:

- Eisenhower Matrix:
    - Important and urgent – do immediately.
    - Important but not urgent – plan.
    - Not important but urgent – delegate or minimize.
    - Not important and not urgent – discard.
  This method brings clarity and reduces anxiety.
- The “Top 3” rule: choose no more than three key changes for the next 3–6 months.
  Focusing on fewer priorities protects patience and prevents frustration.
- Balance: priorities should include both shared and personal changes.
  Balance honors both individuality and union, creating respect and fairness.

## 2. Strategy

Strategy is a set of principles and regular actions that help you stay on course. It includes:

- Principles (e.g., “we discuss important issues once a week,” “we do not make decisions during conflict”).
  Principles reduce defensiveness and create trust.
- Rituals (e.g., weekly planning meeting, family retrospective).
  Rituals bring belonging and stability, reminding partners they are a team.
- Progress check (once a month, we review the table of changes).
  Progress review nurtures recognition, gratitude, and hope.

## 3. Mini-rituals

Simple regular practices help sustain the strategy:

- Daily short check-ins (“How are you today?”).
  Builds connection and calm.
- Weekly discussion of plans and moods.
  Encourages clarity and reduces hidden resentment.
- Monthly retrospective (what works, what needs improvement).
  Creates a safe space for honesty and curiosity.

These rituals create a steady rhythm and reduce the likelihood of accumulating conflicts. Practiced with playfulness, they become not duties but moments of connection.

## Conclusion

Prioritization and strategy help turn intentions into actions. They provide clarity on what is important right now, what can be postponed, and how you maintain movement toward the vision together. Approached with respect, patience, and encouragement, they transform planning into a source of confidence and belonging.
