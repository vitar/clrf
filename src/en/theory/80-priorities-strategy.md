# Chapter 8. Prioritization and Strategy

After defining changes, it is important to set priorities and work out a strategy for implementing them. Without this, there is a risk of overload: too many goals at once lead to burnout or giving up on change.

## 1. Prioritization

Methods of prioritization:

- Eisenhower Matrix:
    - Important and urgent – do immediately.
    - Important but not urgent – plan.
    - Not important but urgent – delegate or minimize.
    - Not important and not urgent – discard.
- The “Top 3” rule: choose no more than three key changes for the next 3–6 months.
- Balance: priorities should include both shared and personal changes.

## 2. Strategy

Strategy is a set of principles and regular actions that help you stay on course. It includes:

- Principles (e.g., “we discuss important issues once a week,” “we do not make decisions during conflict”).
- Rituals (e.g., weekly planning meeting, family retrospective).
- Progress check (Once a month, we review the table of changes).

## 3. Mini-rituals

Simple regular practices help sustain the strategy:

- Daily short check-ins (“How are you today?”).
- Weekly discussion of plans and moods.
- Monthly retrospective (what works, what needs improvement).

These rituals create a steady rhythm and reduce the likelihood of accumulating conflicts.

## Conclusion

Prioritization and strategy help turn intentions into actions. They provide clarity on what is important right now, what can be postponed, and how you maintain movement toward the vision together.
