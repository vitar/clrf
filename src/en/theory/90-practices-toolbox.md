# Chapter 9. Practices from Professional and Personal Toolkit

The **Couple Life Reflection Framework (CLRF)** sets the basics: conditions, needs, and functions. To make changes real, couples can borrow simple practices from professional life and adapt them for daily use. These tools add structure, but used with respect, curiosity, and playfulness, they also strengthen trust and reduce hidden tension.

## 1. VMOSA (Vision–Mission–Objectives–Strategy–Action)

VMOSA is a roadmap for turning ideas into action:

- **Vision** — where we want to go.
- **Mission** — why it matters.
- **Objectives** — clear goals.
- **Strategy** — how we move.
- **Action** — what we do today.

In couples, VMOSA helps transform vague wishes into a shared plan that feels both possible and hopeful.

## 2. RACI (Responsible–Accountable–Consulted–Informed)

RACI clarifies roles:

- **Responsible** — who does the task.
- **Accountable** — who makes sure it gets done.
- **Consulted** — who gives input.
- **Informed** — who needs the update.

Applied to finances, chores, or projects, RACI reduces “I thought you were doing it” fights and makes fairness visible.

## 3. Agile / Scrum practices

Agile offers light routines for staying aligned:

- **Weekly stand-up** — what matters now, what blocks us, what we try next.
- **Retrospectives** — once a month, ask what worked, what didn’t, what to change.
- **Small iterations** — test new habits in short cycles.

These routines prevent overload and turn complaints into curiosity.

## 4. Kanban and WIP limits

Kanban makes work visible:

- **Board** — to do → in progress → done.
- **WIP limit** — no more than 2–3 active items at once.

Whether planning a renovation, trip, or shared project, Kanban builds transparency and keeps expectations realistic.

## 5. Wardley Maps

Wardley Maps show how needs and practices evolve — what’s routine and what’s still emerging.

For couples, maps support big choices like relocation, job change, or long-term direction. Mapping together sparks curiosity and broadens perspective.

## 6. Risk management

Risk thinking prepares for crises:

- What risks exist (financial, health, emotional).
- How to reduce them (reserves, insurance, support).
- How to act if they occur (agreed responses).

Talking through risks lowers anxiety and builds resilience.

## 7. Situational Leadership (D1–D4)

Situational Leadership shows that support depends on readiness:

- **D1** — eager but inexperienced → give guidance and structure.
- **D2** — first struggles → give support and shared decisions.
- **D3** — growing competence → offer trust and encouragement.
- **D4** — maturity → delegate and allow freedom.

In couples, this helps tell when a partner needs more help and when they
