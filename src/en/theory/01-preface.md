# Preface

This work began with my professional habit of structuring everything. As a software engineer and leader, I spent decades using frameworks to make sense of complex systems: from technologies and processes to organizations. At some point I realized that the same principles could be applied to the most important project in life — relationships.

Instead of relying only on advice from articles or on emotions, I decided to build a system that connects logic and feelings. That's how **> CL/RF _ Couple Life System Framework** appeared — a tool that helps couples (my wife and me first of all) become aware of conditions, needs, and functions, and then turn them into shared visions and concrete steps.

This framework will be especially close to those who are used to thinking systematically: software engineers, team leads, tech leads, managers. To those who value clarity, transparency, and strategy at work but face the same challenges in personal life — uncertainty, overload, conflicts.

I hope this tool helps you just as it helped us: turning chaotic conversations into a clear map that leads to a common future.
