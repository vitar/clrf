# Practice 12. Shared Vision

This practice helps you form a shared picture of the future. First, each partner shares their individual vision; then you create a shared one together. It should include a common core (what matches) and respectful acknowledgment of differences (what remains personal).

### 1. Our common core (overlaps)

What is important for both of us in the future:

<br/>
____________________________________________________________
<br/><br/>
____________________________________________________________
<br/><br/>
____________________________________________________________

### 2. Our differences (space for the personal)

What remains personal for each:

<br/>
____________________________________________________________
<br/><br/>
____________________________________________________________
<br/><br/>
____________________________________________________________

### 3. Joint formulation of the vision

Together, formulate 2–3 paragraphs that describe your shared vision:

<br/>
____________________________________________________________
<br/><br/>
____________________________________________________________
<br/><br/>
____________________________________________________________

## Conclusion

A shared vision is a guideline, not a rigid plan. It helps you move in the same direction while preserving each partner’s individuality.
