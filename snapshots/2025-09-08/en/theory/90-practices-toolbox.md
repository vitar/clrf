# Chapter 9. Practices from Professional and Personal Toolkit

The **> CL/RF _ Couple Life Reflection Framework** sets the basics: conditions, needs, and functions. But changes and actions can be implemented through different practices. Many come from the professional environment and can be adapted for a couple. Additionally, tools are included that help in daily interaction.

## 1. VMOSA (Vision–Mission–Objectives–Strategy–Action)

This structure helps build a vision and the path toward it.

- Vision: where we want to go.
- Mission: why we do it.
- Objectives: specific goals.
- Strategy: how we will act.
- Action: what we do right now.

In relationships, VMOSA helps turn abstract wishes into an action plan.

## 2. RACI (Responsible–Accountable–Consulted–Informed)

RACI helps distribute roles and areas of responsibility.

- Responsible: who performs the task.
- Accountable: who is ultimately answerable and approves the result.
- Consulted: who to consult.
- Informed: whom to inform.

In a couple, this can apply to finances or household tasks to reduce conflicts over “who was supposed to do it”.

## 3. Agile / Scrum practices

Agile provides tools for regular interaction.

- Weekly “stand-ups” (what matters now, what hinders, what we improve).
- Retrospectives (once a month: what works, what doesn’t, what to try).
- Small iterations (experiments with new habits).

This helps avoid overload and move step by step.

## 4. Kanban and WIP limits

Kanban makes tasks visible and reduces overload.

- Board: to do → in progress → done.
- WIP limit: no more than 2–3 projects at once.

Applicable to renovations, vacations, or any family projects.

## 5. Wardley Maps

Wardley Maps help see values, needs and practices in dynamics: what has become habitual and what is still new.

For a couple, this is a tool for strategic decisions: relocating, changing jobs, choosing a future direction.

## 6. Risk management

Risk analysis allows you to prepare for crises.

- What risks we have (financial, emotional, health).
- How we mitigate them (reserve, insurance, support).
- How we respond if they occur (rules of behavior in crisis).

This reduces uncertainty and gives a sense of confidence.

## 7. Situational Leadership (D1–D4)

The situational leadership model shows that interaction style depends on the partner’s maturity and readiness. Four states are distinguished:

- D1: enthusiasm without experience – needs support and instructions.
- D2: first disappointments – needs help and joint decisions.
- D3: partial competence – support and trust are useful.
- D4: maturity and experience – delegation and freedom are possible.

In a couple, this model helps you understand when a partner needs support and when they need space.

## 8. Working Agreements

Working Agreements are shared rules the couple agrees on for daily interaction. They codify what we consider important.

Examples:

- We do not make important decisions during conflict.
- We do weekly planning on Sunday evening.
- We use a respectful tone even in arguments.

Such agreements create a sense of predictability and safety.

## 9. Me Manual

A Me Manual is an “instruction about me” written by each partner. It helps better understand each other’s specifics and reduce misunderstandings.

Example contents:

- How I usually react to stress.
- What helps me calm down faster.
- What especially irritates me.
- How best to give me feedback.

Sharing such “manuals” allows us to act consciously and avoid repeating the same mistakes.

## 10. Other practices for interest

There are other popular tools that can be studied and tried:

- NVC (Nonviolent Communication) – communication through feelings and needs.
- Johari Window – exploring blind spots and trust.
- GROW Model – structure for conversations about goals.
- Eisenhower Matrix – classic priority matrix.
- Moving Motivators, DiSC, Big Five, MBTI – personality and motivation models.
- Imago Dialogue – structured dialogue for difficult conversations.
- OKRs and SMART – goal-setting methods.

These practices are not included in the core of the framework but can be useful for expansion and inspiration.

## Conclusion

Professional and adapted practices help translate theory into action. They do not impose rules but provide convenient tools that can be tailored to the style of a particular couple. Incorporating situational leadership, agreements, and personal manuals makes the set of practices more complete and applicable.
