# Chapter 6. Vision

A vision is a picture of the future that a person or couple strives for. It helps set the direction and build a strategy for change. It is important to distinguish fantasies from a vision: a vision must take into account real conditions and needs to be achievable and useful.

## 1. Individual visions

Each partner formulates their own picture of the future. It is important to write in the first person: “I want…”, “I see myself…”. An individual vision reflects personal needs, dreams, and goals. Even if they do not fully coincide, acknowledging these visions is important for understanding each other’s inner world.

## 2. Partner’s vision as seen by the other

A helpful practice is to describe how you imagine your partner’s vision. For example: “I think it is important for you…”. This helps reveal misunderstandings and assess how well you know one another.

## 3. Joint vision

After both partners share their visions, a joint picture of the future is created. It includes a common core (what matches) and room for differences (what remains personal). A joint vision should be both realistic and inspiring.

## 4. Recognition of personal goals and fantasies

Not all personal dreams and fantasies can be realized. However, recognizing them matters: they show values and desires. The fantasy “a house by the sea” may express the value of “calm and space”. Such values can be considered when creating a joint vision, even if the dream itself remains personal.

## 5. Comparison and synthesis of visions

Comparing visions helps reveal:

- Overlaps (common core, basis for the future).
- Differences (where to seek compromise or preserve what is personal).

The synthesized vision of the couple includes the common core and a respectful acknowledgment of differences. This forms a sense of union without losing individuality.

## Conclusion

A vision is a guideline, not a rigid plan. It sets direction and inspires, yet allows changes as conditions and needs evolve.
